This challenge required us to implement two features:

1. Calculate the total number of times each word has been tweeted.
2. Calculate the median number of *unique* words per tweet, and update this median as tweets come in. 


*Part 1 uses 2 modules: the 'sys' module and 'collections' module

*Part 2 uses 3 modules: the 'sys' module, 'collections' module and 'numpy' for calculating the median
    *there is also an alternate way commented out in the file to calculate the median without using the numpy module 

Assumptions:

- Each tweet only contains lowercase letters, numbers, and ASCII characters like ':', '@', and '#'.
- A word is defined as anything separated by whitespace.
